## EquiConv PyTorch implementation

This implementation has been tested under this environment:\
python 3.8\ 
pytorch 1.4\ 
torchvision 0.5\ 
cuda 10.1\

copy the equi_conv.py to the torchvision/ops directory in the torchvision package directory.
run python test.py for testing. 

This is an adaption of EquiConv for tensorflow by C.Fernandez et.al. (https://github.com/cfernandezlab/CFL/blob/523d2fe50ee44ecb2fdf97aacf9251d776f387ed/Models/network.py) and deformable convolution (https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/ops/deform_conv.py).
