## EquiConv PyTorch implementation

This is the adaptation of the Corners for Layout by C. Fernandez et.al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08094)


This implementation has been tested under this environment:\
python 3.8\
pytorch 1.4\
torchvision 0.5\
cuda 10.1


Run python test_CFL for inference and python train_CFL for training
