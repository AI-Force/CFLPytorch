## EquiConv PyTorch implementation

This implementation has been tested with python 3.8, pytorch 1.4 torchvision 0.5 and cuda 10.1

copy the equi_conv.py to the torchvision/ops directory in the torchvision installation directory.
run python test.py for testing. 

This is an adaption of EquiConv for tensorflow by C.Fernandez et.al. (https://github.com/cfernandezlab/CFL/blob/523d2fe50ee44ecb2fdf97aacf9251d776f387ed/Models/network.py)
